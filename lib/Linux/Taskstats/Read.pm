=head1 NAME

Linux::Taskstats::Read - Read Linux taskstats structures

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Linux::Taskstats::Read;

  my $ts = new Linux::Taskstats::Read( -file => '/some/taskstats.log' -ver => 3 );
  while( my $rec = $ts->read ) {
    printf("Comm: %s (uid: %d)\n", $rec->{ac_comm}, $rec->{ac_uid});
  }
  $ts->close;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Linux 2.6.19 kernel introduced real-time task and process
statistical accounting routines. These stats are requested and
gathered via a netlink interface. This module does not interface with
netlink, but it can read a raw binary dump of a taskstats struct
(either from memory or from disk).

=head2 new()

Creates a new taskstats record reader object. Parameters:

=over 4

=item B<-file>

Specifies a file to open. This file should be a binary dump of
taskstats objects (e.g. such as produced by F<getdelays>).

=item B<-ver>

Specifies the taskstats struct version. This is a required
parameter. Try '3' if you don't know what version to use. Otherwise,
look near the top of F<linux/taskstats.h> to see your kernel's current
version.

=back

=head2 read()

Reads a taskstats record from the file specified in either the
constructor (B<new()>) or B<open()>.

  my $rec = $ts->read;

=head2 close()

When you're done reading what you need from the taststats dump, kindly
close the file.

Example:

  $ts->close();

=head2 open()

If you don't know the filename at the time of object construction, or
you've closed the object's filehandle (via B<close()>), you can
(re-)open a new file with this method.

Example:

  $ts->open('/path/to/some/file.log');

=head2 fields()

Returns a list containing all of the fields of the taskstats structure
in the order they appear in F<taskstats.h>.

Example:

  my @fields = $ts->fields;

=head2 version()

Returns the taskstats version this object is currently set to parse.

Example:

  print $ts->version . "\n";

=head1 TASKSTATS STRUCT

A taskstats struct, as returned by B<read()> has the following fields
you can examine (this is the version 3 format):

  version
  ac_exitcode
  ac_flag
  ac_nice
  cpu_count
  cpu_delay_total
  blkio_count
  blkio_delay_total
  swapin_count
  swapin_delay_total
  cpu_run_real_total
  cpu_run_virtual_total
  ac_comm
  ac_sched
  ac_pad
  ac_uid
  ac_gid
  ac_pid
  ac_ppid
  ac_btime
  ac_etime
  ac_utime
  ac_stime
  ac_minflt
  ac_majflt
  coremem
  virtmem
  hiwater_rss
  hiwater_vm
  read_char
  write_char
  read_syscalls
  write_syscalls
  read_bytes
  write_bytes
  cancelled_write_bytes

More information on what is stored in these fields may be found in the
documentation supplied by your kernel. These fields are subject to
change depending on the taskstats version used. They are supplied here
only as a courtesy and reference. Future versions may or may not be
included in subsequent releases of this module.

=head1 TROUBLESHOOTING

Q. I have no idea what this modules is for! What is it for?

A. B<Linux::Taskstats::Read> can read taskstats dumps. If you don't
know what taskstats is, you probably don't need this module (but you
can find out more by reading the 'SEE ALSO' references below).

Q. I get "Invalid type 'Q' in unpack at .../Linnux/Taskstats/Read.pm"
errors.

A. You're not on a 64-bit box (or your kernel has not been built with
64-bit support). This module has to be used on a box that can build
and run taskstats (but may not necessarily be running it at the
moment).

Q. How can I make taskstats dumps that this module can read?

A. See the F<getdelays> program in the 'SEE ALSO' section below for an
example program.

Q. I can't get F<getdelays> to run on my system.

A. Try a 2.6.2x kernel or higher (apparently there were some problems
in the 19 kernel). Beyond that, check with your kernel vendor for
additional support.

=head1 NOTES

The major version of this module will match the latest version of the
taskstats struct it supports natively (e.g., 3.xx for taskstats
version 3, etc.).
